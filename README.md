# A Multi-Disease Detection Framework for Ophthalmology Using Deep Learning for Real-Time Diagnosis
An intelligent ophthalmic disease detection system is being developed for real-time diagnosis of Glaucoma, Diabetic Retinopathy, AMD, Cataracts, Macular Hole, Central Serous Retinopathy, Hypertensive Retinopathy, Papilledema, and Pseudo Papilledema.
A comprehensive dataset is organized by conditions, with images, optional segmentation masks, and labels used for training the model.
A pre-trained ResNet50 model is being fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy in disease classification.
The system is deployed using Streamlit, allowing clinicians to upload images and receive instant predictions through a simple and interactive web interface.
The project aims to create a scalable, cloud-ready solution to improve accessibility to ophthalmic care and enable early diagnosis for better clinical outcomes. 

Objective: To develop a deep learning-based ophthalmic disease detection system integrated into a full-stack application for real-time predictions.

Problem: Delayed diagnosis of eye diseases like Glaucoma, Diabetic Retinopathy, AMD, Cataracts, Macular Hole, Central Serous Retinopathy, Hypertensive Retinopathy, Papilledema, and Pseudo Papilledema leads to preventable vision loss, especially in underserved areas.

Proposed Solution: Leverage ResNet50 for disease classification and create a Streamlit-based web application where users can upload medical images and receive instant predictions.

Key Features: Multi-disease classification with deep learning, Real-time predictions for ophthalmic diseases, and a User-friendly Streamlit interface for easy deployment and access

Steps:

Prepare and preprocess datasets from public sources.
Train and fine-tune the ResNet50 model for high accuracy.
Deploy the model using Streamlit for a lightweight, interactive web application.

Impact: This system enables early diagnosis and helps reduce the risk of vision loss, particularly in regions with limited ophthalmic care.
