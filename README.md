# A Multi-Disease Detection Framework for Ophthalmology Using Deep Learning for Real-Time Diagnosis
# An intelligent ophthalmic disease detection system is being developed for real-time diagnosis of Glaucoma, Diabetic Retinopathy, AMD, Cataracts, Macular Hole, Central Serous Retinopathy, Hypertensive Retinopathy, Papilledema, and Pseudo Papilledema.
# A comprehensive dataset is organized by conditions, with images, optional segmentation masks, and labels used for training the model.
# A pre-trained ResNet50 model is being fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy in disease classification.
# The system is deployed using Streamlit, allowing clinicians to upload images and receive instant predictions through a simple and interactive web interface.
# The project aims to create a scalable, cloud-ready solution to improve accessibility to ophthalmic care and enable early diagnosis for better clinical outcomes.
